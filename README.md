## 📖 Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to analyze historical sales data from a retail business to forecast future sales. Accurate sales forecasting is crucial for businesses to make informed decisions regarding inventory, staffing, marketing spend, and overall financial planning. This project explores time series analysis techniques, primarily using Facebook Prophet, to capture trends and seasonality in sales data.

## 🔑 Key Steps

The project followed a structured approach:

1.  **Data Loading and Understanding:**
    * Loaded the `sales.csv` dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
    * Initial inspection of data structure, types, and missing values.
2.  **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
    * Converted the `ORDERDATE` column to datetime objects.
    * Filtered orders based on `STATUS` to include only completed or relevant sales (e.g., 'Shipped', 'Resolved', 'In Process').
    * Aggregated sales data to a consistent time frequency (e.g., daily sales totals).
    * Handled any missing dates or values post-aggregation if necessary.
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Visualized sales data over time using Matplotlib to identify overall trends, yearly and weekly seasonality, and any unusual patterns or outliers.
    * Decomposed the time series into its constituent components (trend, seasonality, residuals) for deeper understanding.
4.  **Feature Engineering (for Regression Models - Optional):**
    * Created time-based features (year, month, day of week, day of year).
    * Generated lag features (sales from previous periods) to help models learn from past values.
5.  **Model Development & Training:**
    * **Prophet:** Implemented Facebook Prophet, configuring it to capture yearly and weekly seasonality.
    * **(Optional) Scikit-learn:** Explored regression models like RandomForestRegressor using the engineered features.
    * Split the data into training and testing sets chronologically to ensure valid model evaluation.
6.  **Prediction & Forecasting:**
    * Generated forecasts on the test set to evaluate model performance.
    * Produced a forecast for a future period beyond the available data.
7.  **Model Evaluation:**
    * Assessed the accuracy of the forecasts using standard metrics:
        * **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** Measures the average magnitude of errors.
        * **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** Measures the square root of the average of squared errors, penalizing larger errors more.
        * **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error):** Measures the average error as a percentage of actual values.
8.  **Visualization of Results:**
    * Plotted actual vs. predicted sales.
    * Visualized Prophet's forecast components (trend, yearly seasonality, weekly seasonality).
